An all-in one, functioning program allowing users to determine a statistical average amount of materials spun in a given session.

Designed for the game "Cube Collector Online", developed by AspectQuote.

## Functionality

### These items will be implemented as base functionality! Expect these to be part of the program.

Allows users to input the time spent AFKing on a given box, and outputs statistical material rewards at the end of session.

Also allows users to find the best box for any given material, excluding ones that aren't determined by box (Valuable Respite, Slated Chips, Divine Fragments, Tally Dregs, Prefix Remnants)

## Planned Functionality

### These items will be on the backburner until I get the basic program set up. I may not even do them.

Allows users to input whether they are halfspinning, or using tally mods.

Finds Slated/Divine amount from an AFK session, given tally mods.

Finds Tally/Prefix amount from an AFK session, given tally mods AND random box mods.

Gives Unreal/Exotic percent chance from total AFK session, given tally mods. Nobody ever uses exotic multiplier mods, do they?

## FAQ

### Will you use golds and exotics in your calculations?

Nope. Too small of a chance versus reward-- even cubics are iffy but are just enough to have me include them.

### When will this be released?

Soon(tm). Part of it's the actual coding, part of it's the manual data entry required. Both suck.

### How do I run this?

Don't. Not going to tell you until I finish this project :3
